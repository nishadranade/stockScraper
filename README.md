# stockScraper
A scraper that fetches real time data of the S&amp;P 500 listed stocks from Yahoo Finance 

This scraper was build from scratch in Python, using mainly BeautifulSoup4, Numpy, Pandas and urllib

First, I wrote code using the 'wikipedia' library in Python to get the list of S&P 500 companies into a CSV file.
The scraper then iterates through the list of stocks and looks up latest financial data from Yahoo Finance.
